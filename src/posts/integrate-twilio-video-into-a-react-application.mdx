Working on [Teams](https://msft.lohani.dev) gave me a pretty good idea about how video-calling platforms work. For the project, I used [Twilio Programmable Video](https://www.twilio.com/docs/video) to add the video calling feature. In this tutorial series, I am going to explain how I integrated Twilio Video into a React App, so that you can do it too!

## Set up the React App

Before we begin, make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed on your system. Let's start by creating and running a React App locally. Run the following commands on your terminal:

```bash
$ npx create-react-app --use-npm twilio-video-cra
$ cd twilio-video-cra
$ npm start
```

Your app should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

You can go ahead and delete test-related files (`App.test.js` and `setupTests.js`) and `logo.svg` inside the `src` folder, since we won't be working with those. Delete all the code inside `App.css` and replace the code in `App.js` with the following:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return <div className='App'></div>;
}

export default App;
```

The code inside the `src` directory constitutes the code of the client-side of the app.

## Get Twilio Video API Credentials

To be able to use Twilio Programmable Video in your app, you would need to create an account on Twilio and generate an API key for Twilio Video. You can login or create a free account on Twilio [here](https://www.twilio.com/login). You'll need to verify your account through email if you've created a new account. Once you've done that, you'll see your [account console](https://console.twilio.com).

Hover over "Account" on the top right corner of the navigation bar and go to the "API keys" section under Keys & Credentials.

Click on the "Create new API key" button and give a name to your API key. I named mine `twilio-video-cra`. Set the key type as "Standard" and create the key. A set of fields and values like `SID` and `SECRET` will appear. You'll need these values so keep this tab open for now.

Create a file named `.env` in the root of your directory. Add the following code inside it:

```bash
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=
TWILIO_API_KEY=
TWILIO_API_SECRET=
```

Assign the variable `TWILIO_API_KEY` the value of `SID` and `TWILIO_API_SECRET` the value of `SECRET`. Don't enclose the key and secret in quotes.

Go to General Settings of your Account and copy the `ACCOUNT SID` field. Assign this to be the value of `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`.

## Set up an Express server

The next step is to get an Access Token to use the Twilio Video Library, which will be used to authenticate the client-side of our application. We can generate Access Tokens using the Twilio Helper Library. Twilio recommends generating an Access Token for each user on the **server-side** of our application. Create React App is limited in that it sets up an application that only renders on the client-side. Thus we would need to create a server on our own.

I picked [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) for this because it's fast, easy to set up, and I've worked with it before. In a separate terminal tab than the one running your React App, create a folder named `server` in the root directory. Move the `.env` file we created earlier inside this folder.

```bash
$ mkdir server
$ mv .env server/.env
$ cd server
```

Initialise this directory using `npm` and install Express.js.

```bash
$ npm init
$ npm install express --save
```

We'll install a few more libraries that will be useful to us (I will elaborate on why later):

```bash
$ npm install dotenv
$ npm install -g nodemon
```

Create a file `index.js` inside the `server` directory and add the following code inside it:

```jsx
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = 5000;

app.listen(PORT, (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(`Server ready on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

`nodemon` is a tool that helps automatically monitor changes to your node.js application in real-time, without having to restart the application every time you make a change. On your terminal, run the following command and you should see this output:

```bash
$ nodemon
[nodemon] 2.0.12
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
[nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,json
[nodemon] starting `node index.js`
Server ready on http://localhost:5000
```

And voila! Your server is running locally :D

## Generate and Send Access Tokens to the client

We need to install the Twilio Helper Library to generate Access Tokens for the users:

```bash
$ npm i twilio
```

Add the following method at the end of `index.js` file:

```jsx
function generateAccessToken(identity, room, config) {
  // use the twilio helper library to get Access Tokens
  const twilio = require('twilio');
  const AccessToken = twilio.jwt.AccessToken;
  const VideoGrant = AccessToken.VideoGrant;

  // generate a video grant for the room
  let videoGrant;
  if (room) videoGrant = new VideoGrant({ room });
  else videoGrant = new VideoGrant();

  const token = new AccessToken(
    config.accountSid,
    config.keySid,
    config.secret
  );
  token.addGrant(videoGrant);
  token.identity = identity;
  return token;
}
```

To get the value of the `token` generated above, the client will make `GET` requests to the server with the value of `room` (name of the room) and `identity` (username of the user) sent in the params of the request. To handle the `GET` request on the server, add the following method in `index.js`:

```jsx
// read the required environment variables from .env file
require('dotenv').config();
const config = {
  accountSid: process.env.TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID,
  keySid: process.env.TWILIO_API_KEY,
  secret: process.env.TWILIO_API_SECRET,
};

// handle GET requests from the client to send the generated Access Token
app.get('/api/video-token/:identity/:room', (req, res) => {
  const token = generateAccessToken(
    req.params.identity,
    req.params.room,
    config
  );

  res.json({ token: token.toJwt() });
});
```

Notice the use of `dotenv` here. `dotenv` is a library that loads the environment variables from the `.env` file.

## Try it out!

Now that we have the API route set up, let's actually try to fetch the value of the token on the client. Since the client and server run on separate ports (3000 and 5000 respectively), we need to set the server's port as a _proxy_ to the client, so that the React App server knows to send any unknown requests to your API server. This avoids any [CORS issues](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21854516/understanding-ajax-cors-and-security-considerations) as well. Refer to [this page](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development/) for more information.

To do this, add a `proxy` field in `package.json` of the **client** (not the server!).

```json
"proxy": "http://localhost:5000"
```

Finally, let's test the server API by making a `GET` request to it in a `useEffect` hook inside `App.js`. Replace the code inside `App.js` with the following:

```jsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  useEffect(async () => {
    const identity = 'ananya';
    const room = 'room-1';
    const res = await fetch(`/api/video-token/${identity}/${room}`);
    const data = await res.json();

    console.log(data);
  }, []);

  return <div className='App'></div>;
}

export default App;
```

This should log an object on the console of your React App webpage ([http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)). The object would look something like this:

```jsx
{
  token: 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImN0eSI6InR3aWxpby1mcGE7dj0xIn0.eyJqdGkiOiJTSzQ5MDY4NTBlZTJjYjliODhhZjI4Mjg5YmRiNGIwNzlkLTE2MzEyMTU5NDIiLCJncmFudHMiOnsiaWRlbnRpdHkiOiJhbmFueWEiLCJ2aWRlbyI6eyJyb29tIjoicm9vbS0xIn19LCJpYXQiOjE2MzEyMTU5NDIsImV4cCI6MTYzMTIxOTU0MiwiaXNzIjoiU0s0OTA2ODUwZWUyY2I5Yjg4YWYyODI4OWJkYjRiMDc5ZCIsInN1YiI6IkFDZmE0ZmFkMjM2ZmU3ZDQ4MzMzYWVkY2M4YzU2ODM0MmUifQ.YRZBmmSChJArR4PzW0A0W68DMKzJ_tC6EK4aWK17NRc';
}
```

And we're done! We know that the server works as expected and the client can request Access Tokens from the server by simply making `GET` requests.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial we completed the following tasks:

- Set up the client-side React Application
- Get Twilio API Credentials
- Set up an Express server
- Generate Access Tokens on the server using the Twilio Helper Library
- Send the generated Access Token to the client by handling `GET` requests
- Test the working of the server API by making a `GET` request from the client to the server
